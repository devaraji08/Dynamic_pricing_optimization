### Core Components

1. **DynamicPricingEngine Class**
   - ML model training and prediction
   - Price optimization algorithms
   - Historical data management

2. **Flask Backend**
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Real-time data processing
   - WebSocket communication

3. **Interactive Frontend**
   - Modern dashboard UI
   - Chart.js visualizations
   - Real-time updates


## 🧪 Sample Data

The application comes with realistic sample data:
- **50 products** across 4 categories (Electronics, Clothing, Home, Books)
- **1000+ historical transactions** with realistic demand patterns
- **Price elasticity modeling** based on economic principles
- **Seasonal and temporal factors** affecting demand

## 🎯 Machine Learning Details

### Model Architecture
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Features**: Price, day of week, month, competitor prices, inventory levels
- **Training Data**: 1000+ historical sales records
- **Performance**: Typical R² score > 0.85

### Optimization Strategy
- **Objective**: Maximize profit (revenue - costs)
- **Constraints**: Minimum markup, maximum price bounds
- **Method**: Grid search over price range
- **Evaluation**: Predicted demand × profit margin
